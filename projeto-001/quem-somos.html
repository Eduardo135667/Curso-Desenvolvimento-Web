						consequences that are extremely painful.
						Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,

						which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
						But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
						consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
